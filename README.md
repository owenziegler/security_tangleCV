# TangleCV for Secure Message Sharing in Connected Vehicles
#### Members: Youseif Al Saadi, Adnan Moheddin, Muhammed Motiwala, Owen Ziegler

This repository's code simulates a blockchain holding messages between 'vehicles', and simulates the blockchain's response to an attack. The simulation is carried out using both a traditional blockchain and a blockchain using the TangleCV method of organization.


**FOR TESTING OUR CODE**
- The files that should be cloned and to be tested are: extended Linked List, and our messageMaker.py 
- The extended Linked List file is a demonstration of our nodes that are going to be connected, and is meant to stand for vehicles.
- The messageMaker is our encryption code, where it would want to encrypt the messages that are communication between the nodes. 

**REQUIREMENTS** (still not figured out)
- For the message maker, install pycryptodome using "pip install pycryptodome". If the Crypto package is still not recognized, changing the interpreter being used may help.
